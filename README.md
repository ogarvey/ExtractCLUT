# ExtractCLUT

As you may be able to tell from the name, this app began life as a simple console app to experiment with extracting a CLUT palette from CD-i game files.

Has since morphed into a collection of experiments in extracting and parsing files from various CD-i titles, including audio, images, and video.

Given the nature of how the app has evolved, do not expect to see good coding standards, or to be able to run the app without an existing knowledge of the CD-i formats.

A brief notes section exists, content has only just started to be added but I hope this can grow into a useful resource for any others looking to delve into the CD-i's catalogue.

Feel free to raise issues or submit PRs if you have any questions, or improvements to suggest/implement ðŸ™‚
